# School Automation
This is a git repo all about ways to automate the boring work at school. Things that are userscripts, are in the userscripts folder


## Installing TamperMonkey
Userscripts should automatically be ran by a JavaScript injector. My choice is [tampermonkey]([url](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for its easy of use
after its installed I recommend pinning it. After you pin it, click the icon and chose create script then copy and paste the contents of the JavaScript file into there.


### blooket.js
`blooket.js` is an userscript that automates blooket.
#### Features
- Push `m` to toggle the answer menu to display the current answer
- Push `space` to clear the answer log
- Push `c` to toggle autoclicking which automatically clicks the correct answer after 1 second
- Push `h` to turn on highlighting which highlights the answers in a different color
